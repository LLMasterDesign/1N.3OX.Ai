## After Pushing

### Update your README.md clone URL:
Change line 18 from:
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/1n3ox.git
```
To your actual URL, then:
```powershell
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update clone URL with actual repo"
git push
```

### Add GitHub Topics (on GitHub):
- ai-agent
- offline-ai
- ruby
- rust
- compliance
- hipaa
- gdpr
- machine-learning
- security

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Permission denied (publickey)"**
- Set up SSH key: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication
- Or use HTTPS with personal access token

**"Repository not found"**
- Make sure you created the repo on GitHub first
- Check the URL matches your username

**"Updates were rejected"**
- Your local repo is clean, this shouldn't happen
- If it does: `git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories`

---

## Next Steps After Push

1. ✅ Add description to GitHub repo
2. ✅ Add topics/tags
3. ✅ Enable GitHub Pages (optional - for docs)
4. ✅ Create CHANGELOG.md for version tracking
5. ✅ Add CONTRIBUTING.md if open to PRs
6. ✅ Link from 3ox.store (when ready)
