## Security Features

### 1. Machine Binding
Each license key is cryptographically bound to specific hardware.

**Prevents:**
- Unauthorized license sharing
- Software piracy
- Multi-machine deployment with single license

### 2. Cryptographic Signatures
All operations generate SHA256/xxHash64 receipts.

**Provides:**
- Tamper detection
- Non-repudiation
- Court-admissible audit trail

### 3. Expiration Enforcement
License keys can include expiration dates that are verified at runtime.

**Enables:**
- Subscription-like renewals
- Time-limited trials
- Controlled access periods

### 4. Offline Operation
No network connectivity required.

**Guarantees:**
- No data leakage
- No cloud dependencies
- Air-gapped operation possible

---

## Audit Trail

Every operation creates:

**1. Receipt Log Entry**
```
[2025-10-18T15:28:51-05:00] critical_error | file.txt | cd9c47eedf9dfb7b
```

**2. Operation Log Entry**
```
[2025-10-18 15:28:51] 〘⟦⎊⟧・.°RUBY.RB〙
  Operation: critical_error
  Status: COMPLETE
  Details: Hash: cd9c47eedf9dfb7b, Routed to: CMD.BRIDGE
```

**3. Routed Receipt File**
```
Operation: critical_error
File: run.rb
Hash: cd9c47eedf9dfb7b
Time: 2025-10-18T15:28:51-05:00
Routed to: CMD.BRIDGE
```

All three provide independent verification of operations.

## Data Protection Best Practices

### 1. Use Surgical Operations
When possible, specify line ranges to minimize data exposure.

### 2. Review Audit Logs Regularly
Check `3ox.log` and `receipts.log` for unauthorized access attempts.

### 3. Rotate Backup Files
Old backups (`.bak.*` files) should be archived or deleted per policy.

### 4. Secure the License Key
Treat `3ox.key` as highly sensitive. Loss requires vendor contact for replacement.

### 5. Monitor Expiration Dates
Set reminders before key expiration to avoid service interruption.
