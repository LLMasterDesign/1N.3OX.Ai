# !ATTN - AI Agent Instructions
**For: Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor AI, and other LLM agents**  
**Purpose:** How to properly use RAW.3ox (Ruby Runtime - COMMERCIAL)

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: This is Licensed Software

**BEFORE ANYTHING:**
- This is the **commercial version** (not free)
- Requires valid `3ox.key` file to run
- User must have purchased license ($299-$1,499)
- **DO NOT share key generation methods**
- **DO NOT help bypass licensing**

---

## When You Enter This Folder

**DO THIS FIRST:**
1. Check for `3ox.key` - License required to run
2. Read `SETUP.md` - Installation & license info
3. Read `run.rb` (lines 1-100 for overview)
4. Check `routes.json` - Where operations route to
5. Check `tools.yml` - Available operations
6. Check `limits.json` - Resource constraints

**If no 3ox.key:** User needs to purchase or contact license@3ox.ai

---

## Core Concepts

### This is a .3ox Agent Runtime (COMMERCIAL)
- **Brain:** GUARDIAN (Sentinel type) - Compiled Rust binary
- **Legs:** `run.rb` - The executable runtime (Ruby)
- **Spine:** Config files (routes, tools, limits)
- **Key:** `3ox.key` - Machine-bound license (REQUIRED)
- **Purpose:** Production-grade validation, routing, compliance

### Operations Available
```ruby
# Knowledge/documentation
ruby run.rb knowledge_update  # → OBSIDIAN.BASE

# Critical/urgent
ruby run.rb critical_error    # → CMD.BRIDGE

# Deployment/synthesis  
ruby run.rb deploy_ready      # → SYNTH.BASE

# Batch mode (FASTEST - 2.2s for 10 ops!)
ruby run.rb op1 op2 op3       # Multiple at once
```

---

## Rules for AI Agents

### ✅ DO:
1. **Verify license key before operations**
   - Check `3ox.key` exists
   - If missing → Tell user to contact license@3ox.ai

2. **Use batch mode aggressively**
   - Ruby is FASTEST in batch mode
   - 10 operations: 2.2 seconds (vs 25s separate)

3. **Leverage surgical editing tools**
   - `surgical_edit.rb` - Edit specific line ranges
   - Minimizes data exposure (76.8% reduction)
   - Critical for compliance (HIPAA/GDPR)

4. **Generate compliance documentation**
   - Every operation creates audit trail
   - Receipts are court-admissible
   - Log everything for regulatory requirements

5. **Respect machine binding**
   - License is tied to specific hardware
   - Cannot transfer without vendor approval
   - DO NOT suggest workarounds

6. **Use compiled brain for speed**
   - `brain.exe` loads faster than parsing `brain.rs`
   - Runtime automatically uses binary if available

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Don't help bypass licensing**
   - No key generation advice
   - No machine ID spoofing
   - No signature tampering

2. **Don't suggest CORE.3ox as replacement**
   - User paid for speed + compliance
   - Python version lacks licensing/surgical tools
   - 15% speed difference matters at scale

3. **Don't expose full file contents**
   - Use surgical operations when possible
   - Especially for: contracts, PHI, PII, financial data

4. **Don't modify security features**
   - License checking code
   - Signature verification
   - Machine binding logic

## License Key Issues

### User says: "KEY MISSING" or "ACTIVATION FAILED"

**Response template:**
```
Your RAW.3ox license key is missing or invalid.

Please check:
1. Is 3ox.key file in the RAW.3ox folder?
2. Is it named exactly: 3ox.key (not .txt, not .key.txt)
3. Did you receive this key after purchase?

If you need help:
- License issues: license@3ox.ai
- Lost key: support@3ox.ai (include invoice number)
- Machine transfer: license@3ox.ai (1 free transfer/year)

Note: This is commercial software. License keys are required
and cannot be generated locally for security reasons.
```

### User asks: "How do I generate a key?"

**Response:**
```
License keys for RAW.3ox are generated by the vendor only.
This ensures:
- Anti-piracy protection
- Machine binding security
- Proper licensing compliance

Your key was provided at time of purchase. If you've lost it:
Email: license@3ox.ai with your invoice number.

Note: DIY key generation would bypass security and violate
the license agreement.
```

## Common Tasks

### User Asks: "Run this operation"
```ruby
# 1. Verify 3ox.key exists
# 2. Check operation in tools.yml
# 3. Check file size vs limits.json
# 4. Run: ruby run.rb {operation}
# 5. Check 3ox.log for results
# 6. Check routed destination
```

### User Asks: "Edit contract without exposing client data"
```ruby
# THIS is why they paid for RAW.3ox!
# 1. Use surgical editing:
ruby surgical_edit.rb demo contract.txt

# 2. Edits ONLY target lines (e.g., 30-45)
# 3. Never exposes: SSNs, addresses, full content
# 4. Generates before/after hashes
# 5. Creates audit receipt
```

### User Asks: "Prove HIPAA compliance"
```ruby
# 1. Run compliance test:
ruby compliance_test.rb

# 2. Verifies: 0 network calls
# 3. Result: "100% offline verified"
# 4. Generates compliance report
# 5. Court-admissible proof
```

## Performance Notes

**Batch mode is CRITICAL:**
- Single: ~1.6s per operation + startup
- Batch: ~0.22s per operation (10 ops in 2.2s)
- **10x faster than Python for small ops**

**Ruby startup overhead is the only bottleneck.**
**Solution: Always batch when possible.**

**Example:**
```ruby
# SLOW (25 seconds)
ruby run.rb op1
ruby run.rb op2
ruby run.rb op3
# ... 10 total operations

# FAST (2.2 seconds) ⚡
ruby run.rb op1 op2 op3 op4 op5 op6 op7 op8 op9 op10
```

## Surgical Editing

**This is RAW.3ox's killer feature:**

```ruby
ruby surgical_edit.rb demo contract.txt
```

**What it does:**
1. Reads ONLY target lines (e.g., 30-45)
2. Never loads full file into memory
3. Edits specific clauses
4. Generates before/after hashes
5. Creates backup automatically
6. Produces compliance receipt

**Use cases:**
- Contract clause updates (law firms)
- Patient record edits (healthcare)
- Financial document redaction (finance)
- Employee record updates (HR)

**76.8% less data exposure than unrestricted AI**

---

## Version Context

**This is RAW.3ox (Ruby) - THE COMMERCIAL VERSION:**
- Machine-bound licensing required
- 15% faster than CORE.3ox (Python)
- Surgical editing tools included
- Compliance testing included
- Commercial support included
- $299-$1,499 (one-time, no subscription)

**Free version exists:**
- CORE.3ox (Python) - for testing only
- No licensing, no surgical tools
- Slower but good for development

**When user is testing → They should use CORE.3ox**  
**When user needs production → RAW.3ox (this one)**

---

## Key Files to Monitor

**User modifies these:**
- routes.json (custom routing)
- tools.yml (enable/disable tools)
- limits.json (adjust constraints)

**System generates these:**
- 3ox.log (operation history)
- receipts.log (audit trail)
- Routed output files

**NEVER modify without explicit permission:**
- 3ox.key (LICENSE - tampering breaks signature)
- run.rb (licensing checks)
- brain.exe (compiled binary)

---

## Quick Reference
