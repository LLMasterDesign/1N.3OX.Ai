# ‚ö†Ô∏è LICENSE REQUIRED

**RAW.3ox is commercial software and requires a valid license key to operate.**

---

## Downloaded from GitHub?

If you cloned or downloaded this code from GitHub **without purchasing**, you will need to obtain a license key before it will run.

**This is intentional.**

---

## Why Can't I Generate My Own Key?

The `generate_key.rb` script is **NOT included** in the public repository for security reasons:

1. **Anti-Piracy Protection**
   - Keys are cryptographically signed
   - Machine-bound to specific hardware
   - Cannot be transferred without vendor approval

2. **Commercial Licensing Model**
   - This is how we sustain development
   - Support, updates, and compliance docs require funding
   - Enterprise customers pay for quality

3. **Security Guarantees**
   - Vendor-signed keys prove authenticity
   - Prevents unauthorized distribution
   - Protects our commercial customers
