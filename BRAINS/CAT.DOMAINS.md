## Usage

### Setup Workflow

1. **Deploy CAT.3OX**
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```
   
2. **CAT.0 ADMIN gets created** with `CAT.ROUTER` brain (master orchestrator)

3. **CAT.1-5 get created** with domain-specific brains (specialists)

### How It Works

```
File arrives → CAT.0 ADMIN (CAT.ROUTER) analyzes content
              ↓
              Routes to appropriate CAT domain
              ↓
CAT.1 SELF     - Personal development content
CAT.2 EDUCATION - Learning materials
CAT.3 BUSINESS  - Work/career content
CAT.4 FAMILY    - Family/relationship content
CAT.5 SOCIAL    - Social/community content
```

### Customization

Each CAT's brain can be customized by editing its `.3ox/brain.rs` file and recompiling:

```bash
cd "(CAT.1) Self/.3ox"
rustc brain.rs -o brain.exe --edition 2021
```
