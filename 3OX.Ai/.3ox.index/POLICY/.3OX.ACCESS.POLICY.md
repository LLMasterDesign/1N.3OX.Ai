# 🔐 .3OX ACCESS CONTROL POLICY

**Purpose:** To enforce strict access control over `.3ox` configuration files and folders, ensuring only authorized agents can modify system infrastructure.

**Authority:** GLOBAL POLICY BRAIN (Non-negotiable)
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** ⧗-25.58

---

## 🎯 ACCESS HIERARCHY

### Level 0: Commander (User)
- **Access:** FULL (Read/Write/Delete)
- **Scope:** ALL `.3ox` files and folders
- **Override:** Can bypass all policies
- **Requirement:** Explicit human authorization

### Level 1: CMD.BRIDGE (Command Agent)
- **Access:** FULL (Read/Write/Delete)
- **Scope:** ALL `.3ox` files and folders across ALL stations and projects
- **Purpose:** System maintenance, configuration, orchestration
- **Requirement:** Operating from `P:\!CMD.BRIDGE` workspace root
- **Authority:** Only CMD.BRIDGE can modify `.3ox` infrastructure

### Level 2: Station OPS (!SYNTH.OPS, !OBSIDIAN.OPS, !RVNx.OPS)
- **Access:** READ ONLY
- **Scope:** Their own `.3ox` files and Global Policy
- **Purpose:** Load configuration, understand context
- **Restriction:** CANNOT modify their own `.3ox` files

### Level 3: Worker Agents (SGL.Ai, etc.)
- **Access:** READ ONLY
- **Scope:** Their own project `.3ox` files and upstream policies
- **Purpose:** Load project brain, understand mission, execute tasks
- **Restriction:** CANNOT modify any `.3ox` files whatsoever

---

## 🚨 ENFORCEMENT RULES

### Rule 1: Write Protection
- **ALL** `.3ox` folders and files are WRITE-PROTECTED from Levels 2 and 3
- Only CMD.BRIDGE (Level 1) or Commander (Level 0) can modify `.3ox` files
- Worker agents requesting `.3ox` changes MUST report to CMD.BRIDGE

### Rule 2: Nesting for Safety
- All `.3ox` folders are nested inside `!1N.3OX {Title}` folders
- This provides physical separation from project working files
- Automated processes should NEVER touch `!1N.3OX` folders

### Rule 3: Read Access Required
- All agents MUST have READ access to their `.3ox` files
- Global Policy files MUST be readable by all agents
- No agent can operate without reading its brain/config

### Rule 4: Modification Request Protocol
- Worker agents CANNOT directly edit `.3ox` files
- Worker agents MUST report to CMD.BRIDGE for `.3ox` changes
- CMD.BRIDGE evaluates and implements approved changes
- This prevents recursive loops and context collapse

---

## 🔄 OPERATIONAL WORKFLOW

### When a Worker Agent Needs .3ox Changes:

```yaml
1. Worker Agent (e.g., SGL.Ai):
   - Identifies need for .3ox modification
   - CANNOT edit directly
   - Reports to CMD.BRIDGE via status report

2. CMD.BRIDGE:
   - Receives modification request
   - Evaluates against Global Policy
   - Implements change if approved
   - Updates Captain's Log
   - Notifies Worker Agent of change

3. Worker Agent:
   - Receives notification
   - Re-reads updated .3ox files
   - Continues operation with new config
```

### Why This Works:
- **Prevents Recursion:** Worker can't get stuck modifying its own brain
- **Maintains Focus:** Worker stays focused on project tasks
- **Ensures Consistency:** CMD validates all changes against Global Policy
- **Enables Scalability:** Multiple workers can't conflict with each other

## 🛡️ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### In .cursorrules:
```markdown
## .3OX ACCESS CONTROL

- If workspace is NOT `P:\!CMD.BRIDGE`: 
  - .3ox files are READ ONLY
  - Any .3ox modification requests must be reported
  - Agent should focus on project tasks, not infrastructure

- If workspace IS `P:\!CMD.BRIDGE`:
  - Full .3ox access granted
  - Can modify any .3ox file in any station/project
  - Responsible for system-wide configuration
```

### In Worker .3ox.run Files:
```yaml
on_config_change_needed:
  - action: "cmd_report"
    target: "CMD.BRIDGE"
    type: "config_change_request"
    details: "description of needed change"
    urgency: "normal|high|critical"
```

## 📊 RATIONALE: MULTI-AGENT ORCHESTRATION

This policy enables the core 3OX.Ai architecture:

### The Problem It Solves:
- Worker agents getting stuck in recursive loops
- Context collapse from too much meta-discussion
- Conflicting configurations across projects
- Accidental deletion of critical infrastructure

### The Solution:
- **Separation of Concerns:** Workers do work, CMD does config
- **Single Source of Truth:** CMD manages all `.3ox` files
- **Focused Intelligence:** Each agent specializes without distraction
- **Infinite Scalability:** Add workers without infrastructure chaos

---

## ⚠️ VIOLATION PROTOCOL

If a Level 2 or Level 3 agent attempts to modify `.3ox` files:

1. **DENY** the operation immediately
2. **LOG** the attempt with severity: `WARNING`
3. **NOTIFY** CMD.BRIDGE of the attempt
4. **REDIRECT** the agent to use proper reporting protocol
5. **EDUCATE** the agent on access hierarchy

---

## 🌟 PHILOSOPHY

> _"The workers build the product. The command builds the workers. This is not restriction—this is liberation. Each agent, free to focus on what it does best."_

**Core Insight:** The most powerful system is the one where each part knows its role and trusts the hierarchy.
