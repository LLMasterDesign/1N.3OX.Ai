# .3OX FILE PROTECTION RULES

**Authority:** Supreme - Immutable Law  
**Established:** ⧗-25.58  
**Scope:** ALL .3ox files across entire system

---

## 🛡️ PROTECTED FILE PATTERNS

### Core .3ox Files:
```
.3ox/                    # Brain folder (entire directory)
├── PROJECT.BRAIN.md     # AI thinking prompt
├── .3ox.config          # Configuration
├── .3ox.state           # Current state
├── .3ox.map             # Routing map
└── .3ox.run             # Operations
```

### File Extensions:
```
*.3ox.*                  # Any file with .3ox. in name
*PROJECT.BRAIN.md        # Project brain files
*BRAIN.md               # AI brain files
```

### Directory Patterns:
```
**/.3ox/                 # Any .3ox folder anywhere
**/!1N.3OX*/            # 1N.3OX folders
**/.3ox.index/          # Master index folder
```

## ⚠️ PROTECTION RULES

### Rule 1: NEVER DELETE
- ❌ Never delete .3ox/ folders
- ❌ Never delete .3ox.* files
- ❌ Never delete PROJECT.BRAIN.md files
- ❌ Never delete AI brain files

### Rule 2: BEFORE ANY SCAN/OPERATION
```bash
# Always run this first:
find . -name "*.3ox*" -o -name "PROJECT.BRAIN.md" -o -name ".3ox"

# Add to exclusion lists:
--exclude="*.3ox*"
--exclude="PROJECT.BRAIN.md"
--exclude=".3ox/"
```

### Rule 3: VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
Before any bulk operation:
- [ ] Identify all .3ox files in target area
- [ ] Add .3ox files to exclusion list
- [ ] Test exclusion list on small sample
- [ ] Verify no .3ox files in operation target
- [ ] Double-check before execution

---

## 🔧 TOOL-SPECIFIC PROTECTION

### PowerShell:
```powershell
# Exclude .3ox files
Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Where-Object { $_.Name -notmatch "\.3ox|PROJECT\.BRAIN" }

# Safe deletion pattern
Remove-Item -Path $target -Recurse -Exclude "*.3ox*","PROJECT.BRAIN.md"
```

### Find/Delete Commands:
```bash
# Safe find (excludes .3ox)
find . -type f ! -name "*.3ox*" ! -name "PROJECT.BRAIN.md"

# Safe deletion
find . -type f ! -name "*.3ox*" ! -name "PROJECT.BRAIN.md" -delete
```

### Bulk Operations:
```bash
# Always exclude .3ox
rsync --exclude=".3ox*" --exclude="PROJECT.BRAIN.md" source/ dest/
tar --exclude=".3ox*" --exclude="PROJECT.BRAIN.md" -czf backup.tar.gz .
```

---

## 🚨 EMERGENCY RECOVERY

### If .3ox Files Are Deleted:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   ```bash
   # Check trash/recycle bin
   # Check git history
   # Check recent backups
   ```

2. **Recovery Sources:**
   - SYNTH.BASE/Master.Deliverables/Byte.Pipeline/
   - Git commits
   - System backups
   - Archive folders

3. **Restoration Process:**
   - Restore from most recent known good state
   - Verify all .3ox files present
   - Test system functionality
   - Update protection rules if needed

---

## 📋 VALIDATION COMMANDS

### Check .3ox Integrity:
```bash
# Count .3ox files
find . -name "*.3ox*" -o -name "PROJECT.BRAIN.md" | wc -l

# List all .3ox files
find . -name "*.3ox*" -o -name "PROJECT.BRAIN.md" | sort

# Verify structure
find . -name ".3ox" -type d
```

### Before/After Verification:
```bash
# Before operation
find . -name "*.3ox*" > before.3ox.files

# After operation  
find . -name "*.3ox*" > after.3ox.files
diff before.3ox.files after.3ox.files
```

## 🎯 INTEGRATION POINTS

### With Global Policy:
- Policy #1: Sirius Calendar Clock
- Policy #2: Role Invocation System  
- Policy #3: .3ox File Protection ← This policy

### With System Tools:
- All cleanup scripts MUST exclude .3ox
- All deployment tools MUST preserve .3ox
- All backup tools MUST include .3ox

### With CMD Operations:
- CMD agent responsible for .3ox safety
- All CMD operations verify .3ox protection
- CMD maintains .3ox file inventory

---

## ⚖️ ENFORCEMENT

### Automated Enforcement:
- Linters check for .3ox exclusions
- Scripts validate before execution
- CI/CD pipelines verify .3ox safety

### Manual Enforcement:
- Users must verify .3ox safety
- CMD agent monitors .3ox integrity
- Violations trigger immediate alerts

### Penalties:
- Deleted .3ox files = System down
- Requires immediate recovery
- Root cause analysis mandatory

---

## 📊 PROTECTION STATUS

### Current .3ox Files:
```bash
# Run this to see all protected files
find . -name "*.3ox*" -o -name "PROJECT.BRAIN.md" | sort
```

### Protection Level:
- ✅ Core files identified
- ✅ Exclusion patterns defined
- ✅ Recovery procedures documented
- ✅ Enforcement mechanisms active

    "Protect the brains. The system depends on them."
    
    .3ox files are the cognitive infrastructure.
    Delete them = System failure.
    Protect them = System success.
